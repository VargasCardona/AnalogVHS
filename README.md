# AnalogVHS
Unity project that implements a first-person horror game set within an industrial environment. The game draws inspiration from the analog horror genre, incorporating visual and audio elements that emulate the aesthetic of old VHS tapes and analog video distortions. The primary objective is to collect 12 VHS tapes scattered throughout the labyrinth, each containing unsettling video footage.
